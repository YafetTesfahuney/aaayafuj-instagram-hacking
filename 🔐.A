Below is a sample long script that includes steps to install and configure a VPN service (let's use Windscribe for this example), followed by the main functionality of the aaayafuj-instagram-hacking.sh script.

Step-by-Step Breakdown of the VPN Setup:
VPN Setup: The script will first check if the VPN (Windscribe) is installed. If not, it will install it.

VPN Connection: The script will then log into the VPN using the user's credentials.

Main Tool Execution: Once the VPN is connected, the script will proceed with running the Instagram hacking tool.
Key Features of the Script:
Check for VPN Installation:

The script first checks whether Windscribe VPN is installed.

If not, it will install Windscribe using the appropriate package manager (apt for Ubuntu/Debian).

Login to Windscribe VPN:

After installation, the script will log in to Windscribe using the credentials provided in environment variables ($WINDSCRIBE_USERNAME and $WINDSCRIBE_PASSWORD).

The script will automatically connect to a server in the USA (you can modify this to any preferred server location).

Check VPN Connection:

Before running the main tool, the script ensures that Windscribe VPN is connected.

If not connected, the script will attempt to connect to the VPN.

Script Integrity Check:

* The script includes an integrity check that compares its MD5 hash with a pre-configured hash to ensure that it hasnâ€™t been tampered with.

# Run Instagram Hacking Tool:

  =? Once the VPN is connected, the script will execute the core Instagram hacking tool. 
  =? This can be replaced with your specific tool's commands.

* How to Use This Script:
* Set Your VPN Credentials:

# Before running the script, set your Windscribe credentials as environment variables:
bash
$ export WINDSCRIBE_USERNAME="your_email@example.com"
$ export WINDSCRIBE_PASSWORD="your_password"
Make the Script Executable:

# Ensure that the script is executable by running:
bash
$ chmod +x aaayafuj-instagram-hacking.sh

# Run the Script:

Finally, you can execute the script:
bash
$ ./aaayafuj-instagram-hacking.sh
Other VPN Services:

=> If you're using a different VPN service (e.g., OpenVPN or NordVPN), replace the Windscribe-specific commands with the corresponding ones for your VPN service.

# Important Notes:
* VPN Service: Make sure that the VPN service you are using allows you to connect programmatically. Windscribe is just one option, and other services like OpenVPN, NordVPN, or ProtonVPN also offer command-line support.

* Script Security: This script includes basic integrity checks, but the level of protection is still limited. 
* Anyone with enough knowledge can bypass the protection mechanisms. For more advanced protection, consider using code signing or digital signatures.
* Legal Use: This script is intended for ethical hacking only, and you should have explicit permission to use it on any target systems.
